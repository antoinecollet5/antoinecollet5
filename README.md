I'm Antoine Collet. I am currently a numerical simulation engineer at Orano Mining. Despite my academic background in mining-geology/reactive-transport, I am enthused by open source software development and share as much as possible of the scientific codes I develop.

Don't hesitate to check out my pinned repositories to see which of my projects are the most popular and why so!
